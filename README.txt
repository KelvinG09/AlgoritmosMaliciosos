# To use this program, you will need to have Python or Python3 and the ast and argparse modules installed.

## To run the program, use the following command:

Copy code

python main.py /path/to/python/file

or 

python3 main.py file.py

[ Depending of version of python you are on ]

## You can also use the -f or --fix flag to automatically fix identified vulnerabilities:

Copy code

python main.py /path/to/python/file -f

This program will analyze the specified Python file and identify potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows. If the -f flag is provided, the program will also generate fixed code for these vulnerabilities.

The program will print out a list of identified vulnerabilities, and if the -f flag is provided, it will also print the fixed code and save it to a new file with the original filename plus a .fixed extension.



Please note that this program is intended for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for production code. It is always important to thoroughly test and review any code for vulnerabilities.
